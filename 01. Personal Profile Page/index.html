                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>I studied Fine and Industrial Art at the polytechinic Ibadan. I love designning expecially with my
                    laptop coupled with the fact that i majored in Graphics Design and i wanted something more so i took
                    a course in web design and i enjoyed every bit of it. I am passionate about building responsive and
                    user-friendly websites and applications. I hope to use my skills, drive and qualifications in the
                    growth of an organization. My project experience in web design have equipped me with solid
                    foundation in frontend technologies and i hope to learn more programming languages.
