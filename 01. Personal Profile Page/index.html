        <p>My name is Olasupo Aminat Olayinka. I studied Fine and Industrial Art at the polytechinic Ibadan. I love
            designning expecially with my laptop coupled with the fact that i majored in Graphics Design and i wanted
            something more so i took a course in web design and i enjoyed every bit of it. <br>
            I am passionate about building responsive and user-friendly websites and applications. I hope to use my
            skills, drive
            and qualifications in the growth of an organization. My project experience in web design have equipped me
            with solid
            foundation in frontend technologies and i hope to learn more programming languages.
